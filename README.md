Predictive Healthcare Analytics for Breast Cancer Detection

This project focuses on building a machine learning–based predictive system to assist in the early detection of breast cancer using medical diagnostic data. The goal was to accurately classify tumors as benign or malignant by analyzing various tumor-related features.

The project involved data preprocessing, including data cleaning, feature scaling, and preparation to improve model performance. Multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest were trained and evaluated.

To enhance accuracy and efficiency, hyperparameter tuning techniques like Grid Search and Bayesian Optimization were implemented and compared. An enhanced model was developed by selecting optimal parameters, which resulted in improved prediction accuracy and reduced false classifications.

This system demonstrates how machine learning can support healthcare professionals by providing fast, reliable, and data-driven diagnostic assistance, helping in early disease detection and better decision-making.
